Projet non-réalisé de ma formation chez BeCode, je décide aujourd'hui, purement pour le fun, de retoucher à ça.
Voici un copier-coller des consignes.

"Pew-pew is a shooting game made in javascript(canvas).

## The elements

To make this game, you need :

- A shape or an image representing a cannon
- A shape or an image representing a projectile
- A shape or an image representing a target

## Specifications

- The cannon can move horizontally at the bottom of our canvas.
- The projectile appears according to the position of the cannon.
- The target appears randomly in the area above the cannon.
- When the projectile hits the target, the target disappears and a new one randomly appears in the area above the cannon.
- You need a button to start the game
- You shoot with the space bar, you move with the keyboard arrows.
- The game ends when the player has reached 10 targets.
- You need a button to restart

## Bonus
